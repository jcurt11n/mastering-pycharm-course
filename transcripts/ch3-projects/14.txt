00:01 You've seen how PyCharm worked with projects, now it's your turn.
00:05 It's your turn to open PyCharm, play around with it
00:08 and explore some of the features around projects
00:11 and you can just go and open any old project and play with it
00:15 but I actually have a set of hands-on instructions
00:18 for you to follow if you'd like.
00:20 So over here on the github repository under tree master your turn 01 projects
00:26 we have some specific things for you guys to do
00:30 to make sure that you remember and practice the various things around projects.
00:34 Let's explore them.
00:37 So this is your first hands-on exercise.
00:39 Let's go over here to the repository
00:42 notice, there's a your turn section here
00:44 and there's a your turn for almost every single chapter in this course.
00:50 So let's go over here and look at projects and see what we got going on.
00:54 So for projects, we have two things we're going to do
00:56 open up a new project or create a project
00:59 and add some code to it and run it
01:01 and then we're going to open a somewhat complicated existing project
01:04 configure it in PyCharm and then run it as well.
01:08 So you can just follow the steps, it should be pretty straightforward.
01:12 So we're going to go create a sort of a hello world
01:14 and make sure that you use the virtual environment
01:16 feature in Python, 2017.3 or greater.
01:21 This is nice, you get to play with this
01:23 and we'll come down here and you also get to
01:25 open up the jumpstart course demos
01:28 and play with the wizard class here, the wizard game
01:31 and one of the things to make sure that is the goal of this part
01:35 is to not just make sure that you run it with a virtual environment,
01:37 but also that this line 4 here has no squigglies, no errors.
01:41 So you'll see how to do that as you go through
01:43 and if you find any sort of mistake in these instructions,
01:47 you can submit an issue or a PR to fix them.
01:50 I've tested it out, hopefully it's all working well for you,
01:52 so go out there, take a few moments and try PyCharm here.
