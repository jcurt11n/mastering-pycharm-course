00:01 We've seen for large applications or large directory structures at least
00:05 this concept of marking a directory as some sort of thing is really helpful,
00:11 this is especially helpful in the web actually.
00:14 So we go over here and we right click on the directory
00:17 we say mark directory as, we get these 4 choices here
00:19 so let's look at the 4 choices:
00:22 the first one is sources roots,
00:24 so this contains all the actual source code and files
00:27 and PyCharm uses this as the point for resolving imports.
00:30 We saw in our example that I tried to import some things from actors
00:34 like the wizard and the dragon and stuff
00:37 from the actors in that little silly game I created,
00:39 and it said there's no actors, I went up to the top of this entire directory structure
00:43 and said there's no module called actors,
00:46 but it was right next to it right,
00:48 so I said look this is actually where these files refer to each other
00:50 by saying market as a sources root.
00:53 We also have resource roots, this is for static things
00:57 like style sheets and images and Javascript and so on,
01:00 so this is actually super helpful for the web
01:04 because when you create things like Pyramid Web Apps
01:06 there's a whole structure that is not the exact same structure in the project
01:11 as it maps to the website, and because of that
01:15 PyCharm typically will tell you every single CSS file,
01:18 every single Javascript file is not found,
01:21 is not there and it won't help you with any sort of auto complete
01:24 in your HTML or your templates.
01:27 But, all you've got to do is right click and say mark it as a resource root,
01:31 and everything falls into place, so that's really handy for the web.
01:34 I don't really know how this would be used outside the web.
01:38 Excluded roots, these are things that PyCharm will basically ignore saying
01:42 don't look at this for trying to index stuff
01:46 or try to read these files and understand them,
01:51 so we did this for our virtual environment for example
01:54 as well as my little transcript folder,
01:56 those were just resources that were in the git project
01:59 but had nothing to do with our program really.
02:02 Finally, templates roots, this is just where you put
02:06 your Jinja 2 or your Chameleon templates in your web app
02:08 and when you create things like Pyramid web apps
02:10 you'll see that it actually automatically
02:13 marks the template folders as template folders
02:16 you have don't to do anything there, but for some reason
02:18 you've created one more by hand
02:20 and you want to indicate like, here's the template folder just use that.
