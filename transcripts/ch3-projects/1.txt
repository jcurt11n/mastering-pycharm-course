00:01 Now that we've talked about by PyCharm a little bit
00:04 and why you want it, things like that, and you've got it all set up,
00:07 it's time to start using PyCharm to do some really cool stuff.
00:10 We're going to start by focusing on projects.
00:13 We're going to cover many things as you saw in this course,
00:16 but one of the central ones is this concept of a project,
00:20 loading a set of files, piecing them together, working with the relationships,
00:25 doing things like navigating from one file
00:28 via definition of a method call say into another,
00:31 or setting up the project structure so that if I'm running a web application
00:37 it will give me say auto completion for the static files
00:41 even if the static files are not really the root of the project folder
00:45 but root of the web, the conceptual web app, things like that.
00:50 So we're going to focus on the really important parts of the project
00:54 which mostly means how do we put a bunch of files together
00:57 and navigate them and run them.
