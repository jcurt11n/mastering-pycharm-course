00:01 You've seen how to create new projects and open existing ones.
00:04 For the new ones, we just click the create new project
00:07 icon or button thing here and you get a list,
00:10 what do you want a pure Python basically empty project,
00:14 do you want a Pyramid web app,
00:16 do you want a Google App Engine configured app or whatever.
00:22 You pick the type here and later you'll see
00:24 that we can actually install NoJs as an option
00:26 for things like ElectronJs and those as well.
00:29 So this is actually extensible through a plugin thing
00:33 that we'll talk about at the end,
00:35 but for now, these are sort of the default out of the box options.
00:37 Just give it a name, select your Python interpreter and hit create and off you go.
00:41 If you want to load an existing project,
00:44 you can either go to the file menu and say open directory,
00:47 click that thing, it says 'open,
00:51 or if you're on a Mac, you can drag this onto there and it will open it.
00:56 And basically, that'll come in as the project root, it'll discover all the files,
01:00 you saw there is already a git repository in place,
01:03 either with the new or the existing, it'll import that as well
01:08 and automatically integrate source control.
01:11 We'll talk way more about source control later,
01:13 but it automatically sort of gets setup for you,
01:16 it at least prompts you to click a button to set it up.
01:19 The one thing that we're not doing here in this picture
01:22 is creating the virtual environment
01:24 inside the existing directory before we open it,
01:27 so I'll show you how that goes in a later concept,
01:29 but that's the way I like to get started,
01:32 because every one of my applications has its own virtual directory
01:35 so it's totally isolated with the right naming conventions
01:39 that happens automatically in PyCharm.
