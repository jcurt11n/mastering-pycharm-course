00:02 Unit testing is important for reliable code
00:05 and PyCharm has support for most of the ways
00:08 that we do testing in Python, let's try pytest.
00:11 Over here we have a starter project,
00:15 in the beginning it doesn't really have any tests
00:18 but it does have at least some working code
00:22 that you can write some tests for,
00:24 so over here, we're going to do a couple of things
00:27 first we're going to configure the pytest test
00:30 which is not super obvious on how to do in PyCharm until you've seen it,
00:33 and then we want to use code coverage to see how well we're doing,
00:36 realize we need some more tests, write a few more tests,
00:39 realize now we have great code coverage.
00:42 So we'll start out by opening up your table
00:44 create a virtual environment in it, open it in PyCharm, standard stuff,
00:48 so we need to add a run configuration for the tests
00:51 and so you need to go edit the written configuration,
00:55 drop down, pull down, hit edit, go over here and add a new Python test
00:59 pytest option, it talks about the settings to use to get it to work,
01:03 when you run it you'll see, stuff is not so much working
01:06 and they're all failing,
01:09 now, that's okay that it's failing, for now,
01:11 let's just run it with code coverage and see how much code
01:15 we're even trying to run with our faulty test.
01:18 So we're going to come over here and run the test with coverage
01:20 you may have to click the little button
01:22 to install coverage.py into your virtual environment
01:25 and then what you're going to do is you're going to start implementing the tests
01:30 and you'll see in the test code,
01:32 there's some little notes on how to do that what you need to do,
01:35 once you get all the tests to pass
01:38 and core.py has on 100% code coverage, you are done,
01:41 you should see some awesome like this, all green at the end.
