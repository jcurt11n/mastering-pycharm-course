00:02 Let's get your Linux machine all set up and ready to go.
00:05 We're going to need to do two things,
00:07 install Python or verify or update the version and install PyCharm.
00:12
00:15 Over here on python.org,  you'll see that the latest version is 3.6.4
00:19 and as long you have 16.10 or higher
00:24 you should have a pretty recent version,
00:26 I think even 16.04 is pretty good.
00:29 So you come over here and see what version you have,
00:31 we can say python3- V we have 3.6.3
00:35 that's the latest you can get on this, I think this is 17.10, I'm sure that it is.
00:40 So this is pretty much the latest we're going to get
00:43 even though over here we have a slightly later version,
00:45 this is what ships and that's more than good enough for this course.
00:48 If for some reason you have an old version,
00:50 I'd say anything 3.5 or higher is totally good,
00:53 you could do a sudo apt update
00:57 and then see if there is something here for Python,
01:01
01:03 so you see like Python 3 update options here, go ahead and do that,
01:07 obviously updating your system is a good thing
01:09 but we should have Python stuff already set up and ready to go,
01:14 and Python 3 is what we're using for the course
01:16 so you going to want to have that.
01:19 Now, what about PyCharm—
01:21 let's go over here, there are two options for installing PyCharm,
01:23 one option is we can come over here and we can go straight to the PyCharm page
01:28 and download it, this is one option
01:31 and notice right away you're hit with a choice for
01:34 something we can either download the pro version or the community edition.
01:39 Now, community edition is great for a lot of things
01:42 and much what you'll see will work there
01:44 but many notable features will not exist, the database tooling,
01:47 the web tooling and a number of other ones are going to be missing,
01:51 so I really recommend you get the professional edition for this course.
01:55 So that works pretty well, but let's try something a little bit slicker,
01:59 if you're going to have more than one app from Jetbrains
02:03 like say WebStorm and PyCharm,
02:05 you can subscribe to their entire set of tools, like 20 different applications,
02:10 you can get this thing called the Toolbox app
02:13 even if you are just using PyCharm, you can use the Toolbox app
02:16 so go and download this and I just did a minute ago, so here it is.
02:20 So we can go open this up and let's just put it somewhere and get it going,
02:24 so over here, let's make a folder bin and let's extract this thing into it.
02:34
02:38 So we have this thing called Jetbrains Toolbox and let's go over here,
02:42
02:47 we need to make this executable, see it's green, not executable,
02:50 so we want to change mood a + x
02:57 and then once we do that, we can just run it,
03:00
03:03 this comes up and says you want to allow it to send us things like that
03:07 and over here it says what do you want install,
03:10 let's install either PyCharm community, PyCharm professional or both,
03:13 we just hit this, it is going to go download it, install it, I'll give it a second to finish,
03:19 there you have it, PyCharm professional 2017.3.2 is installed and we can run it.
03:27 So this thing should be ready to go
03:29 and notice over here once you work with some projects
03:32 you'll have actually interesting history that you can just quickly go from.
03:37 One other thing to notice if you go to the settings here
03:40 is we can have it automatically update itself and I am logged in as me,
03:45 so this will give me access to all my licenses
03:47 so you'll have to go ahead and log in potentially the first time when you run this.
03:52 Okay, so that's all good, we can now run PyCharm and see what we get.
03:56
03:58 There you go, it looks like it's opening this last project that I worked with,
04:02 not super exciting, it was just some random thing that I played with,
04:06 but here it is, right, this untitled thing that was in the recent projects history.
04:11 The last thing to note, under settings, this will automatically run that log in,
04:19 if we reboot, it should be back and keeping our PyCharm nice and up to date.
04:24 So we already checked if we had the right version of Python
04:29 which comes with most modern Ubuntus,
04:31 and we use the Toolbox app to install and manage PyCharm.
04:34 Let's see if we can get to it— here it is, perfect,
04:39 you might even want to pin that to your favorites once you have it running.
04:43
04:48 Here it stays right there close and active for us, we can just get right back to it.
04:53 This Linux machine is ready to take this course,
04:57 you don't need anything other than Python 3 and PyCharm,
05:01 we got those two set up, we're ready to go.
