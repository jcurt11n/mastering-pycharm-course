00:02 Let's talk about setting up PyCharm on your operating system.
00:06 Now there's going to be three of these videos,
00:09 one for MacOS, one for Windows and one for Linux.
00:11 Unless you're just curious, you don't have to watch them all,
00:14 just skip to the one that is your operating system and then go with that.
00:17 So we'll start with Mac, I'm going to use a Mac
00:19 for this course, for my demos and so on,
00:22 but you can use whatever you want,
00:24 PyCharm works on all three operating systems.
00:27 So we're going to go and download the necessary version of PyCharm
00:31 and the necessary version of Python, so let's go do it.
00:35 First you want to make sure you have Python,
00:38 now on Mac you can always go over here and type Python-V
00:44 and you'll have Python 2, it is shipped with that
00:46 but it doesn't usually have Python 3.
00:48 Now I've already installed it, so you can check
00:51 to see whether you have it by typing that, I have 3.6.4, it is great.
00:54 If you don't, you want to download it,
00:56 so there's two options, one straightforward
00:58 you come over here, you make sure you download
01:00 whatever the latest version of Python 3 is,
01:02 this course is based on Python 3, if you have only Python 2,
01:04 a lot of the code is not going to work or it is going to be a little bit different.
01:08 PyCharm supports it but this course is not focused on it.
01:12 So this is one way, another way that is really nice is to use Homebrew,
01:16 so Homebrew is a really sweet package manager for the Mac,
01:20 now you run a Ruby command to get it set up, and it's based on Ruby
01:23 but you don't really care, Ruby comes with Mac so it's all fine.
01:26 And then once you get it set up, you just brew install Python 3
01:30 and then when you work with it, just like you saw me type
01:33 Python 3 will launch the Homebrew installed Python 3 interpreter.
01:37 So that's pretty cool, you can definitely get Python that way.
01:40 But you're going to need to install Python 3 if you don't have it,
01:43 you saw the command to check to see if you do,
01:45 it's just Python 3-V, see what you get.
01:49
01:52 Next step, we want to get PyCharm.
01:55 You can go and just download it right here,
01:57 I would recommend getting the professional edition
02:01 you can get the community edition,
02:03 but a lot of the features we talk about, they're not there,
02:05 the web tools, the Javascript tools, the server side tools,
02:09 the database tools, those are all in here
02:12 so you're going to want the pro version
02:15 there's a free trial, you can get it, or you can pay a few bucks,
02:17 maybe you already have it.
02:20 So if you have this, that's great, this is one way to do it.
02:22 Notice down here it says get the Toolbox app to download it,
02:26 alright, so if we just download it this way,
02:28 it's totally simple, you just run this installer, drag this baby over and run it,
02:34 so that's about as easy as it gets, right.
02:36 The other thing though is, let's talk about this Toolbox app,
02:41 so this is pretty cool, if you're going to buy more than one thing from Jetbrains,
02:46 if you want access to more tools,
02:49 there's a way to sort of subscribe to all of their tools,
02:52 so I believe the way you get that is maybe just /toolbox
02:56
03:00 and then yeah, you just say get toolbox.
03:02 And there's like a yearly subscription type thing, similar
03:05 it's a little more than PyCharm but not terribly more, let's see what it costs.
03:09 If we pay yearly it's going to be 249 for first year
03:13 and then, basically onward it's like 200 and 150.
03:19 That's nice, this is how I do it
03:21 because I use a lot of the various tools from Jetbrains,
03:23 so if you have that, let's check this out,
03:26 so over here, you have this thing running, this is the little Toolbox app
03:29 and it just has all the tools there for you,
03:32 so for example apparently there's an update for PyCharm,
03:35 and I could tell it to do this automatically, just always keep them up to date,
03:38 maybe I want to do something else,
03:40 maybe I am considering writing some swift code
03:43 and also I have app code, so if you have licenses for all of these things,
03:46 like down here this WebStorm will reference WebStorm
03:49 this will reference DataGrip which is right there,
03:52 you just click this and wait for a few moments, and it'll just be installed.
03:55 So I'm not going to wait for that to finish,
04:00 but maybe we'll see some notification along the way.
04:02 You can either install PyCharm directly
04:05 or install the Toolbox and get it that way, take your pick.
04:07 Once you have those two things done,
04:10 that's really all you need for this class,
04:12 I can't think of anything else that we use that you are going to need
04:15 so do those two things, get Python 3, get PyCharm pro up and running
04:20 and you'll be ready to take this course.
