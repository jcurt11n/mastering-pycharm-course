00:02 Packages play a central role in Python.
00:05 One of the main powers that Python has
00:09 is that you can go to PyPI and find among the 120,000+ packages
00:15 something to do almost anything,
00:18 you want to reach inside MP3 files and change their tags and album art,
00:22 fine there's totally a couple options to do that,
00:25 you name it, there's a good chance that it's out there.
00:27 So either you want to consume and work with one of these packages
00:30 or maybe you want to build one and make it 120,001
00:34 which would be awesome.
00:37 So we'll see that PyCharm has support
00:39 both for working with packages as a consumer and as a producer.
