00:02 Have you created a Python package before?
00:05 Well, you're going to now,
00:07 because we're going to create a new Python package
00:09 and use the PyCharm tools to make it installable
00:13 and get the right structure, all those kinds of things.
00:15 Over here, we're going to start from just blank,
00:19 so you don't need to check out any code for this one,
00:22 but what we're going to do is we're going to create a new project,
00:24 we're going to make it into a package,
00:27 not just a random Python project,
00:29 we're going to add a silly little feature to it
00:32 so you can run some code and play with it,
00:35 we will create a setup file so that other people can install
00:37 say from PyPi or other places your package;
00:40 and finally, we're going to use that one by creating a virtual environment,
00:44 running our setup to test that there
00:47 and then importing the package to make sure it works.
00:49 So you get a little background on what packaging in Python is
00:52 we're going to come over here and see
00:55 how you can use the PyCharm tools to make it a package,
00:57 add a feature, it's just a simple little calculator app
01:01 that lets you create like an add and subtract method
01:05 so really, really simple, we're not going too far down into anything advanced here,
01:10 the code is not what's important, it's the package.
01:12 So we're going to call it Calcy, our little simple calculator,
01:15 hopefully, that doesn't conflict with anything you have installed,
01:18 I tried to name it something that probably doesn't exist.
01:20 And you see that you can import it, use its math submodule and add function.
01:26 They want to create a setup package,
01:28 beware that PyCharm may go overboard
01:33 with all the virtual environment packages in there
01:35 so you have to clean that out, that's kind of unfortunate it does that
01:39 maybe it will stop by the time you take this class, but right now it does it,
01:42 and you'll see how to activate it
01:44 notice the steps on Windows are slightly different than they are on Mac and Linux,
01:49 we're going to run the setup
01:52 and make sure you go somewhere else on your file system
01:55 not the working folder because it'll just pick up the package right there
01:59 so then we're going to run the Python REPL,
02:01 and just interact with it like you saw before.
02:04 Alright, so go and create a calculator package.
