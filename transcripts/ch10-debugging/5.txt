00:01 When you're debugging your code
00:04 it's really important to have great tools to visualize
00:07 and understand exactly what's happening
00:09 and view the entire state of your app
00:11 and we saw the PyCharm debugger is pretty top-notch at that.
00:14 So let's go take an existing application
00:17 and use debugging to understand its workflow.
00:19 So over here in 7-debugging,
00:22 we've got math_tricks which is an existing little application that we're going to use
00:28 we come down here into the core,
00:30 this is the part we're going to try to understand
00:32 and what we have is we have two generator methods, this yield keywords
00:35 and generator methods are kind of weird
00:37 you can think of them as restartable or pause and resume these methods
00:43 so really, really cool in the way they work, really efficient
00:46 but also kind of funky to understand,
00:48 so what we are going to do is we're going to come down here
00:51 and open up this project, open this in PyCharm,
00:55 and we're going to run it just to make sure everything is hanging together
00:59 you should see something like this,
01:01 so we're going to play with breakpoints,
01:03 we're going to use the visual debugger to step through and understanding the code flow
01:06 and we're going to even alter the way the application runs
01:10 by changing some of its state,
01:12 which makes it go down different paths in the if block and things like that.
01:15 So, open up this project, these math tricks
01:18 and play with the debugger and see how it all works.
