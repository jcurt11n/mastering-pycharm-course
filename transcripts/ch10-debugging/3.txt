00:02 Now let's come back and look at a slightly different scenario.
00:04 Maybe something weird is going on right around the time
00:08 when o is greater than and 500, or something.
00:12 So we could start out by putting a breakpoint here and say
00:16 okay what's going to happen at this particular side,
00:21 okay so o is 1, great, so we keep going, o is 3
00:25 and we can even do this version to just keep running to the next breakpoint,
00:28 13, 21, okay, 233, 987 right,
00:33 now maybe that's where something is happening
00:35 we want to stop now and look at it and see how it's evaluated
00:39 this is super common when you have lots of loops
00:41 or you maybe have some accounts and you're working with your web app
00:47 and you want to see what when we get to this particular account,
00:49 or this record that is an entry in our stores catalog or something like that
00:55 and you want to stop on that one, that's the problematic one.
00:57 So there's a couple of things we can do
01:00 we can come down here, first of all we can add special watches right
01:04 we can say well I'm interested when o is greater than 500,
01:09 it's true, so let's start over and is it greater than 500? no
01:16 run, run, run, right, obviously this is easy for you looking
01:21 but there could be much more complicated things you're testing
01:24 this thing equals that, this set is contained in that set right
01:27 so you could do that sort of testing.
01:29 Now this is switched to true, great
01:31 so this sort of ability to watch these expressions and not just variables is cool
01:35 but we can do better, so let's come over here and say right click
01:39 and notice all the stuff we get whether this is enabled
01:41 whether it should suspend just this thread or all the threads,
01:45 what is the condition here, let's say o,
01:49 notice, intellisense, autocomplete right here, so fantastic
01:55 500, we could even get more
01:58 if we click this we could even have it log a message
02:02 let's say log a message here, something like that,
02:05 we could say stop, there's all sorts of features we can do here
02:08 so now if we just restart or debug, wait for a second,
02:13 bam, it stops exactly when the first time o is greater than 500
02:18 it will save you a ton of time
02:21 and by the way, it even logged that breakpoint reached
02:25 we could even put out a little better message or something
02:27 but click right here it takes you right back,
02:29 not super interesting because we were there
02:32 but far away, click here takes you right back.
02:34 Notice the icon right here, there's a little question mark
02:37 because this isn't always a breakpoint it's a conditional breakpoint.
02:41 So these conditional breakpoints I don't find I use them that often
02:45 but when I do, they're really helpful
02:47 because you're not juggling around all these different scenarios
02:50 you just put it into the breakpoint,
02:52 let it run and it stops right when it should, it's great.
