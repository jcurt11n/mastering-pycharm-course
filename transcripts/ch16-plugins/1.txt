00:01 It's time to focus on the plugins and there are so many things
00:05 that we can add to by PyCharm to make it do awesome stuff,
00:08 maybe you wanted to support Vim key bindings and it doesn't,
00:12 well just go to the plugins and add them,
00:14 you want to work with NodeJS, we saw that was a plugin,
00:16 you can do that, or ElectronJS, all sorts of stuff,
00:19 and we'll see there are a bunch,
00:21 we'll survey some of the ones I think are notable
00:23 and look and explore how you might add third party or external ones.
00:29 Plugins are things we can add to PyCharm,
00:32 over here in the settings slash or angle bracket whatever plugins
00:36 and there's a bunch of them built in and you need to be a little careful here
00:40 because the ones that come with PyCharm,
00:42 these are the ones that basically support the features of PyCharm,
00:46 so for example, we have cvs integration,
00:49 maybe you don't care about that but right above it, css
00:52 you might care about css support and if you uncheck it,
00:55 you won't be able to get any help with css files anymore.
00:58 So be a little careful in that much of this stuff
01:01 is actually the functionality of PyCharm itself,
01:04 but then you'll see we can turn them on and off
01:07 and we can also add new ones and maybe the most exciting thing there is
01:11 that we could just go get a ton of other cool things
01:13 that were not built in and bring them in.
01:16 So let's go do some playing around with these.
