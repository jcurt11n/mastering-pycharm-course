00:01 So you've spent quite a while with PyCharm to get this far in the course,
00:05 and you might be interested in a little bit of the backstory,
00:08 where did it come from, who were the people behind creating PyCharm.
00:12 I want to highlight an episode of the Talk Python To Me podcast
00:16 that I recorded with Dmitry Trofimov.
00:19 So Dmitry is one of the core developers on the PyCharm team,
00:23 and back in November 11, 2015, so a little bit ago, but still relevant,
00:29 I interviewed him about PyCharm, his work there
00:33 and the internal workings of PyCharm,
00:36 there is actually a ton of interesting stuff here,
00:38 so if you feel like spending an hour
00:40 with me and Dmitry just chatting about PyCharm,
00:43 well, head over to talkpython.fm/36 and check it out.
