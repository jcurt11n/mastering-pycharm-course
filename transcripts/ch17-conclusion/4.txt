00:01 I hope you've been taking advantage of the your turn exercises
00:03 while you are going through this course.
00:06 But, if for some reason you haven't,
00:08 be sure to go over here and go through the various exercises,
00:12 we've got one for almost every chapter that we cover in the course,
00:16 and they vary in time between say 10 and 30 minutes for the very longest one,
00:21 depending on your experience level.
00:23 So I think these will really help drive home,
00:25 and highlight the various features that we talked about,
00:28 and will help you remember much like I talked about in the wheel there,
00:31 this is one of the practice steps right at the beginning
00:34 that I think will make a big difference.
