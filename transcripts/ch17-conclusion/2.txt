00:01 Remember at the beginning we talked about how to learn the features of an IDE.
00:05 And if you see a picture, if you open your screen and you see this here
00:10 you may think, oh amazing, look at all what this does
00:12 or you may be like oh my gosh, I just want to edit some code,
00:15 how do I work with all this stuff.
00:18 So you really need to learn the features of the IDE
00:20 to make every one of these things be a benefit
00:23 and not just a distraction at best.
00:25 So let's review the technique that I talked about.
00:28 Now, when I introduced it, it was maybe abstract
00:32 but we've seen so many features that you probably want to use,
00:35 how are you going to remember them?
00:38 Well, remember I said you should first discover what those features are,
00:41 and that to a large degree is what the purpose of this course is,
00:46 it takes you through all the features, it shows them in action
00:49 it shows you the true benefit and the particular times to employ those.
00:54 We kind of solved the discover problem,
00:57 obviously there's more to discover, but you've got a bunch of that
01:00 now you need to remember them, which is tricky,
01:03 and you need to practice them.
01:05 So I had this plan for how you could do that.
01:07 There's the cheat sheet that you download from the beginning of the course,
01:12 then you can install presentation assistant,
01:16 which I hope you did, that's one of the plugins
01:19 and that will tell you every time you work with a menu item
01:21 or you do something it will tell you what the name of the feature is
01:24 it will tell you what is the hotkey is,
01:27 which I think is really important to learn the hotkeys of everything,
01:30 and then get yourself a set of sticky notes
01:32 or a piece of paper cut up into small pieces,
01:35 write down the things that you're like I really like this from this course
01:39 and I want to make sure I make it part of my daily routine,
01:41 and put one of those sticky notes on your monitor
01:45 and try to make use of that every time it makes sense,
01:48 maybe one of them is refactor to a method or refactor this,
01:51 maybe one of these is just to use conditional break points or something like that,
01:57 you could write down 50 of these things
02:00 and put one on your monitor until you've used it enough
02:03 you feel like yeah, that's totally going to stick.
02:05 So these three things I think can really help,
02:07 hopefully this course has helped as well.
02:10 Do make a concerted effort to find all the features you care about
02:15 and find a way to make them part of your daily routine,
02:17 at first it might seem overwhelming,
02:19 there will be a bunch of things you have to learn,
02:21 but in the end, you'll really have many more super powers,
02:25 I described this at the beginning of this section,
02:28 you'll have these powers and ways to work with your code
02:32 that maybe you didn't have before.
