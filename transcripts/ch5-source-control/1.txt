00:01 Now that we have our editor up and running
00:03 the very next thing we want to do
00:05 is make sure we put our code in source control so that it is safe.
00:08 The last thing we want to do is lose a bunch of hard work
00:11 and of course, if you're going to work with anyone on a team
00:14 you need good source control, and PyCharm has a ton of built-in features,
00:19 for many of the common version control systems
00:21 and you'll see it has a nice UI for those, as well as deeper integration
00:26 like the editor actually represents source control features.
00:29 The project listing has stuff for source control, all those kinds of things.
00:34 So, let's get right into it.
00:36 The first question you want to ask is—
00:39 is my favorite source control system supported and natively built-in?
00:43 The answer is very likely 'Yes'.
00:46 So of course, git is supported, git and github
00:49 and to a slightly lesser degree, Bitbucket.
00:52 These are definitely the most popular ways that people work with source control
00:56 so git is deeply supported in PyCharm,
00:59 but we also have Subversion, if you want to go back to the year 2000,
01:03 you could definitely use some Subversion.
01:06 They have Mercurial, they have CVS,
01:09 you maybe haven't used that unless you've been around for a while,
01:12 but in the 1990's that was quite popular.
01:14 They also have support for Perforce,
01:16 so all of these are built-in and really nice.
01:19 If you are using Team Foundation Server TFS,
01:23 or Visual Studio team system, whatever they're calling it these days
01:26 or, god forbid, SourceSafe, you can get those but they're not built-in,
01:31 they don't come with it, you have to go to the plug-in section,
01:33 go to the very last chapter of this course and check out the plug-in section
01:37 to see how to get to that.
