00:02 Source control in PyCharm is really comprehensive
00:05 and for git that can mean it's kind of overwhelming
00:07 the first time you see it I suspect
00:10 unless you're really experienced with git.
00:12 So here's your chance to explore in a hands-on way how to work with git
00:16 and other features around source control from within PyCharm.
00:21 So over here on GitHub under your turn 3 source control
00:26 we have basically two things that you're going to do
00:28 one, you're going to use git source control from within PyCharm.
00:31 You're also going to use local history.
00:34 So local history as we saw lets you work basically in your own file system
00:39 as if you had a little bit of source control
00:41 obviously, it's not shared even for you across machines.
00:45 So the first thing that we're going to do is actually build a game
00:49 that we can call hilo or guess that number game or something.
00:51 And so it's going to do something like this.
00:53 Hey guess a number between 1 and 100.
00:56 50, it's too low, 75 too high and you kind of use the binary search here
01:00 and narrow in on looks like it was 66 this time.
01:03 You're supposed to write this game,
01:05 create a project that gives you some steps on how to do it
01:08 and create this game, use the random module
01:12 to basically come up with random numbers.
01:15 If you really need some help, over in the Jumpstart course under apps 02
01:20 and here there's steps under you try and there's a final one,
01:23 which basically is this working code,
01:25 but I thought it might be fun for you to write really simple game here
01:28 and then check it into source control.
01:30 Okay, so this talks about how you put this into github up at the beginning
01:35 we start out with some code from github here, things like that
01:40 or how you just simply create a local git repository.
01:43 You actually don't check in anywhere,
01:45 but it would work effectively the same you just can't push.
01:48 So you play around, write that code
01:50 and you play around with source control here according to steps
01:53 and then later on, you get to play with the local history
01:56 which may or may not have some of the same saves
01:58 as you had in your source control,
02:01 but it'll probably have more depending on how you worked with the code.
02:05 All right, so get out there and try that source control.
