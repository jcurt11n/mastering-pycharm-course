00:01 Now you know how to use a proper source control system like git,
00:04 it will be not super different for Mercurial or for Subversion or any of those other things.
00:09 But— you don't always check in every change
00:12 and sometimes you really would like better more fine grained accuracy
00:19 for the changes that have happened to your files.
00:21 Like, if you make a change and then you decide to throw that change away
00:25 or you keep going and you end up breaking something
00:28 you are like oh, I wish I had checked it in, like 30 minutes ago
00:31 and then I could roll it back to there, but I got a roll it farther back
00:35 because that's all the history that I have in my source control.
00:38 Git solves this little bit with local check ins
00:41 and you can have more fine grained,
00:43 but still I contend that there are times when you are like
00:45 I really wish I had a version of this, and you don't.
00:48 So, PyCharm has this amazing thing called local history
00:51 so independent of whether we were in a git repository
00:55 or had any source control configured at all,
00:58 local history is always active
00:59 and you come down here and go to a particular file and view local history,
01:03 there's not a whole lot to it,
01:05 we could put a label or we could just show the history, watch this.
01:08 Here is the life-cycle of this program.
01:11 Back here, we had zero files
01:16 and then we created this one file here, right,
01:21 and then we made some changes,
01:25 so if you click through, it just shows you
01:28 all the various changes that happen, now it is starting to get interesting.
01:32 l'll show you these files, how they've changed over time,
01:36 these are identical, here is another one,
01:39 okay, so basically you get the various changes that you've seen over time.
01:45 Now, there's a bunch of changes that have actually nothing to do with this program.py
01:49 so I'll just stay here, but this is really, really awesome
01:53 we've got local tracking of any change,
01:56 and also it shows you where we checked in the other changes.
02:00 Let's go and make some more changes
02:02 let's suppose first I'll put a label
02:05 so this will be factored, saved, right
02:09 you don't have to put labels but you can.
02:11 So let's go over here and let's import random
02:15 and let's go and say start=random.randint
02:23 and we're going to start somewhere between 90 and 110
02:28 and we're going to end by going to let's say 130 140
02:39 so we'll come down here and instead we're going to say start
02:42 and let me put a save, end
02:45 and maybe let's put one line here again.
02:50 So let's just run it and see what happens
02:53 all right it looks like it went from
02:56 way back 105 to 137 was what it came up with the end.
03:00 So that seems totally reasonable.
03:03 Now let's go back to this local history one more time.
03:06 Now we can see some more meaningful changes
03:08 so over here, we tagged it,
03:10 notice when we do a commit it actually tags it automatically
03:13 but over here we get that as well.
03:16 Now you can see we factored, we sort of labeled and we saved it
03:21 and we made one change we came down here like this
03:25 and we said okay, we'll go and have this version
03:29 and then, we can get this one, this is where we added that new line there,
03:33 so you can see, we started out with no randomness
03:38 and then we added that random,
03:40 I think this def is the current one.
03:43 So this is what it was before
03:46 and then we go up here and then we added that new line down there.
03:51 So things kind of moved around a little bit
03:54 but this is really, really helpful, I would say at least one time,
03:58 I badly lost some file that I thought was in source control
04:02 and for some reason it wasn't, I deleted it and then I needed it back actually,
04:07 it turns  out I was able to use local history to get it back exactly,
04:10 so I don't use this often but when I do use it it's like really, really hopeful.
04:15 It's also great if you're working in a project that doesn't have source control set up yet,
04:19 this is kind of like your wimpy source control,
04:22 super, super cool stuff, you can even do a little revert here.
04:26 Okay, so local history— definitely, definitely check it out
04:31 it's a parallel, independent version control that only lives in your project files.
