00:03 To start our exploration of source code and its integration with PyCharm,
00:06 let's just look at our github repository here, mastering pycharm course,
00:10 we've already talked about where this lives,
00:12 but you'll notice that there's really nothing going on here
00:15 like a little while ago, I put the course image and I've updated the read me apparently
00:19 but nothing has been committed
00:22 and also notice that there are two branches
00:24 like imagine, this is just to sort of pretend,
00:26 I'm doing some sort of feature branch thing
00:28 so I've got this feature branch one
00:31 and maybe I'll issue a pull request back to the main master branch.
00:36 What we want to do is we are going to go back to the code that we already wrote
00:40 and when I first did that, we did the editor stuff and the project stuff
00:44 what I did is I created a folder called "demos" in here
00:47 but I didn't check it in or anything, because we hadn't gotten to the source control part yet.
00:52 So here we are in one of those programs
00:54 remember we got one, we can go and download from the podcast
00:57 so I could run this and it will tell us what the items are
01:01 basically available on Talk Python right now.
01:04 So you can see that we're getting,
01:08 I guess we are getting the 0 to 
01:14 129th one down here, we're not getting all of them.
01:17 Here in program, we're only showing this little bit.
01:19 You can see this is working fine, but it has not been checked into source control
01:23 so how do we go about this?
01:25 I created this folder inside, let's go to my desktop,
01:29 I created this folder here inside the course,
01:33 here you can see the read me, and all those kinds of things.
01:35 We go over there, let's say go to the desktop course,
01:39 this is a git repo, and we have some files in here,
01:43 some that are new, some that are modified okay,
01:48 so let's go check that out.
01:50 Now, if I just open this project,
01:52 automatically it knows it's part of git, so go to the menu first
01:55 up here notice there's a bunch of non grayed out
01:58 commit, update source control options
02:02 and we could go and say check out from github
02:06 or some other types of things,
02:08 but because we've already opened it
02:11 there's actually a lot of git features available to us.
02:13 So we could commit a file, we could add it,
02:16 we can merge changes, we could reset it to the latest, all of these sorts of things.
02:20 I could even create a pull request, how cool is that.
02:23 So a lot of stuff can happen up here
02:25 notice there is also a local history which is amazing
02:27 we'll talk about that in a minute.
02:29 For now, we're going to focus on the real,
02:31 grown up git source control stuff.
02:34 So, this is all great, you might use that,
02:37 but typically I find myself here extremely rarely.
02:40 So let's look down here,
02:43 notice this, it says git master, how awesome is that?
02:47 Because we're in a repository it automatically knows,
02:49 actually the very first time we opened it, it noticed it was a git repository
02:53 and it asked should I add integration for it and I said yes,
02:56 so that's technically the yes it's required,
02:59 but down here now if I click on it, I get branch information.
03:01 Notice I could tag a branch, create a new branch, I'm on master local
03:05 and on remote, I have my feature branch
03:09 so I could do things like check it out,
03:11 because it doesn't exist in local and things like this
03:14 so we'll come back to the branching,
03:16 but notice right away it tells us sort of where we're working
03:19 and then up here, these are all the run options
03:21 but on the right, we have update project, commit the changes,
03:26 this shows the history, not committed, so there's no history, we'll revert it back.
03:31 So this little group of four things is also your source control.
03:35 And finally, it might not be obvious yet,
03:37 let's go ahead and mark this as excluded so we don't look at it,
03:41 the green here actually means this is a new file
03:46 so if I go back over here, it is this little bit right here.
03:53 The green means new file here,
03:55 if it were modified it would actually be blue not red,
03:58 and if it were not tracked it would be basically that color.
04:02 So if I go over here and I add another file
04:04 let's just call this other.txt,
04:07 I told PyCharm when I created this project
04:11 that it was allowed to automatically add things to source control,
04:14 but if I added it without, it would show up as red.
04:17 So now let's go ahead and commit these,
04:20 probably the first thing we want to do is get the latest changes.
04:24 So we can go over here and say get me the changes
04:26 and we'll just pull those down,
04:29 it says okay, everything's up to date, great.
04:31 Now let's go ahead and check them in,
04:33 so let's go commit, so we'll come down here and it says
04:36 these are all the files that we're actually going to commit for you
04:39 there's some project files that's going to track for us
04:43 but these are the ones that we're looking at
04:45 and then there's a bunch of unversioned files that it's not tracking
04:47 some project files that we could ignore we'll come back to that later.
04:51 Okay, so what we want to do is we want to check those in,
04:55 we'll give it a message, whatever it is you do when you do your check in
04:59 so this is committing the early work.
05:04 We could come over here and reformat the code
05:07 according to our rules before we check it in,
05:10 we could do certain things like optimize the imports,
05:13 perform code analysis, other types of clean up.
05:17 So there's all sorts of stuff, we could even push it to production if you would like,
05:20 I am not a fan of that but you can.
05:23 So down here you can see your differences,
05:26 this is all green because it's all new, not a lot going on.
05:28 Now remember git is two staged,
05:30 so if I just click commit, it's just going to stage it locally,
05:33 what I really need to do is commit and then push those changes up,
05:37 so I'll do that all in one shot.
05:40 And it comes back, it says
05:42 okay you need to push this stuff, you are going to push it here,
05:45 we could push tags and things like that, but let's just go.
05:47 Wait a second— ta-da, it was updated.
05:52 Now if we go back to github and we refresh,
05:55 There it is, committing the early work, 17 seconds ago.
06:00 So we come down here, we were on this one, the podcast.
06:04 So, down here we're got the work that we did, awesome.
06:08 Let's go over here and make some changes,
06:10 because we're not quite done exploring this yet.
06:13 So I told you if we made some changes that the color would change again,
06:17 so let's go and suppose in program, what we want to do
06:21 is we actually want to get 120 to 141,
06:25 so we made some changes here, and if I go over there,
06:30 notice it's already turned blue, that means it's been changed,
06:33 it was in source control, it's been changed.
06:35 I can come over here and I can save, and we could say
06:38 show me the history now,
06:41 now we have some history, right, this was checked in,
06:43 so we have our local changes, our log of what has been changed,
06:47 our console down here for our git action,
06:50 and then this, we could actually show the diff on
06:54 that is not super interesting yet, is it;
06:58 because we just checked it in.
07:02 Alright, so last thing, let's do it from here, actually this one from here,
07:08 so we could compare with the current version,
07:11 now we can see that we've changed this one line, right,
07:16 so this is standard git changes.
07:19 Okay, so pretty awesome, let's just go and push our final change up,
07:22 later episodes, something like that, and we'll do a commit and push,
07:28 and push, awesome, I'll commit it.
07:36 Finally, let's look at annotations,
07:40 so if I click on annotate, it will come along an it will say
07:44 who has made these changes, when the changes were made,
07:47 you can click here and it will actually show you that check in, right,
07:51 if I click on this one, it will say look
07:53 we just checked in that one file with this change,
07:56 if I click here— now it's not super interesting
07:59 because there is only 2 versions and it was all me,
08:01 but you can imagine in a real application in a real project over time,
08:04 this annotate is super cool.
