00:00 The final thing I want to cover while we're talking about client side Javascript
00:03 just to sort of show how far you can push this is Electron JS.
00:07 So I'm not sure if you are familiar with Electron JS,
00:09 it's pretty awesome, it basically takes Node and Chrome
00:13 and packages that up into a self-contained executable
00:17 that looks like a native application on Mac OS and Windows.
00:21 So you probably have interacted with Electron JS apps,
00:25 so Electron JS actually came from Atom, from github,
00:30 but we already saw that we were playing with Visual Studio code earlier
00:34 and just to paste out some information, and this is an Electron JS app
00:41 it looks just like standard Mac OS app here,
00:45 and it looks like a Windows app over there.
00:47 Another one is Postman, great for APIs.
00:49 So over here we could hit the RSS feed for Talk Python,
00:53 what do we get— wait for it to download
00:56 here you can see that's the RSS feed, right.
01:00 So these are all Electron JS apps,
01:03 so let's see how we might use this in PyCharm.
