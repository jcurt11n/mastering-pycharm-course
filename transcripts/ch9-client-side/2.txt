00:01 Now let's play around with some of the HTML and Javascript features here.
00:05 Notice in the web clients side I have made a web app
00:08 because we're also going to have a Node JS thing over here
00:11 so let's go and open this, we can say open this in the browser, default,
00:15 and here we just have our default test bed
00:18 and what we need is we just want to see the console
00:20 we're going to go down there and see the output,
00:22 nothing yet but it's coming.
00:24 So let's open this and our Javascript file here
00:27 and we're going to write a function
00:29 so let's suppose that we're going to write a function
00:32 it's called run at load, not taking any parameters or anything
00:35 and right away PyCharm is saying hold on, hold on,
00:38 here's a function it's not being called anywhere in this project.
00:41 So it's really nice that we have this dead code detection
00:44 but let's go ahead and call that, notice auto complete as you would expect there
00:47 and we're going to come over here and let's just
00:51 person = "Jeff" and then I'm not going to do a console.log the person's name, right?
00:58 we could even do something like nice to meet you, like so.
01:05 Now there's something we're doing wrong here, can you catch it?
01:08 Obviously there is something wrong with person but what is it?
01:11 I guess it depends how much Javascript you write,
01:13 but is it that we made person in here global.
01:16 And we need to run this of course,
01:18 I haven't put the link in to pull in the Javascript
01:21 so we can do that quickly like so
01:23 and generally I put my Javascript at the end
01:26 unless it's one of the front end framework type things,
01:29 there we go, nice to meet you Jeff, that's cool,
01:32 but now there's also this person object that's global,
01:36 so what do we forget— we forgot to do var,
01:39 and there's a ton of these things, just like in the Python part
01:43 we saw a bunch of little fixes or code intentions
01:45 over here in PyCharm we also have them, like so.
01:49 So this is really nice that you get these code corrections and whatnot
01:54 if this took parameters something like that,
01:57 it would come over here and we would know that these are not being used,
02:02 so there are all sorts of nice little checks that we have in our Javascript code.
02:06
02:11 The other thing to keep on your mind I guess
02:13 let's just add one more Javascript file here
02:16 let's call this home.js and over here we can actually do some other stuff
02:22 let's say define another function, registerAction,
02:27 actionName, something like that
02:30
02:32 so go over here and then let's just add a registerAction really quick,
02:35 load or something, remember in this place we had a runAtLoad
02:41 so again we have run at load talks about where it comes from
02:45 and all those types of things,
02:47 it even has help with modules and dependencies and things like that
02:51 when you're working with multiple files
02:53 especially around the Node JS type of things
02:55 so I probably need some more interesting Javascript
02:57 to show you a bunch of the features
02:59 but you have many of the code intentions,
03:01 you have the refactoring all the things that you guys would expect.
03:04 So we come over here and refactor
03:06 actually let's refactor this one, it's more interesting across
03:10 so we can come over here and say runAtLoadButOnce
03:14 go back here, runAtLoadButOnce, it's beautiful.
03:19 Okay, so the Javascript tools are really great
03:23 we already saw a lot of the HTML and CSS stuff on the server side
03:26 but of course, it's the same story here.
