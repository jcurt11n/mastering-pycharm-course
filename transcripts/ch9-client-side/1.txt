00:01 We've seen the server side features of PyCharm's capabilities
00:05 with regard to Python based web frameworks.
00:09 But, as you likely know, web applications are not just server side things
00:13 there is Javascript, there's HTML, there's CSS
00:16 and there's all the things surrounding that
00:19 and spun off from that Javascript front end frameworks,
00:22 things like Vue JS, Angular JS, that have their own syntax
00:27 and would really benefit from having understanding within the editor,
00:30 as well as things like LESS, SASS, TypeScript and whatnot
00:35 that needs sort of precompiled to actually get ready to use in your web app.
00:40 So we are going to look at that side of the story for PyCharm right now.
00:43 So we're going to see about creating projects, just like we had in Python,
00:49 these code intentions, these little code helper fixes.
00:53 We have the same thing in Javascript
00:57 for taking code that might not be ideal
00:59 and transforming it into something better.
01:01 We'll talk about support for popular frameworks,
01:04 like Angular JS and Vue JS and so on,
01:06 TypeScript, LESS and SASS, even Node JS and on top of that,
01:12 ElectronJS which is pretty sweet as well,
01:14 that's not obvious how to get those last two,
01:17 so we'll see how to do that in the course.
