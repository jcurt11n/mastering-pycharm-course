00:03 Now let's look at one of these Javascript frameworks
00:05 and see how we get even better support in PyCharm.
00:08 So here we have Angular JS and this is one of the more popular ones,
00:11 I showed you the Ionic example and of course,
00:14 that's based on Angular so that's pretty cool. 
00:16 And over here is a little tutorial
00:18 on working with Angular JS like these little things here,
00:22 and you can go and edit the HTML and the CSS to make this happen.
00:26 So let's look over here, I do a little reformat,
00:29 we've got a link to Angular, this is Angular 1.0,
00:34 it doesn't really matter, the way it works is all basically the same.
00:39 So we come down here, we have our code here
00:43 first thing we've got to do is we've got to go here and say
00:46 this is an ng app, let's put that away there, like so.
00:52 So we'll say this is our app and then down here
00:55 we're going to have things like ng-click, so if I type ng
00:58 you can see I've got -bind, -app, -class, -cloak,
01:02 all the various things that you would do
01:04 and now we have actual Angular JS help not just HTML, CSS and Javascript,
01:10 but support for all that, let's have a look here.
01:13 One more time in our browser,
01:16 and see what we've created or copy and paste, take your pick.
01:20 So it looks pretty good so far, if we click around
01:22 you can see our little Angular JS app is working,
01:24 granted it doesn't do very much, but it's quite easy to build
01:29 as you can see with all the support for the Angular JS features
01:33 and I find this really helpful because I don't do Angular JS so much
01:36 so I am like is it ng-bind, is it bind colon,
01:40 how do you do conditionals in here, and all this kind of stuff,
01:44 controllers, routing, all the things you do in Angular,
01:47 it's really nice to be able to just leverage the intellisense that is built in here.
