00:01 Over here on the electronjs.org page, go down a little bit,
00:04 it'll show us a little quick start thing that we can do.
00:08 We can go clone this thing and then go in there
00:10 and we just install and run.
00:14 Let's go over to PyCharm first and create a place to do that.
00:19 I'll have this electron_test or something like that,
00:29 so we copy this path, it will be really easy to get there, like so.
00:34 Now, what it says we need to do is we need to clone the repo
00:39 so that's going to download the various bits of HTML, so we don't have to type it,
00:45 we'll go into the little quick start which is here
00:49 and we'll see that we have an index and a main.
00:51 The last thing we have to do is
00:53 install the various Node modules to make this work
00:57 so we can come over here and run this,
00:59 give it a second— and off it goes and runs.
01:04 So this is not a super advanced little thing right here,
01:07 but you can see that we do have a native Mac application
01:13 and there's stuff going on here,
01:15 so let's get out of there, we can go and exit it.
01:18 Let's take this back to PyCharm.
01:21 So here we now have our Node modules and all of this
01:27 and we can actually set this up to run inside of PyCharm
01:31 so we can edit it, we can use all the cool stuff
01:35 with TypeScript and LESS and whatever else you want to use to work with it.
01:40 The first thing we've got to do is make sure that we have the Node plug-in installed,
01:45 so if you go to plug ins and then you see that you have Node—
01:48 it turns out we don't have Node, so let's go browse for Node
01:53 and we want this one, the Node JS, okay
01:59 so this takes a moment because we've got to download and then restart PyCharm,
02:02 okay we're back, we don't have anything to run this
02:12 and there's not a great way to right click
02:15 so we have to be a little more explicit
02:17 but just notice now that if we went to new project we do have this Node concept,
02:21 this is really only for Node web apps, the server side not Electron.
02:25 So let's go over here and say edit configuration
02:29 and we're going to add something for Node JS
02:33 and let's call this Electron and not hit enter,
02:38 so over here it says we're going to run Node and that is not what we want,
02:45 we want to actually do something a little bit different,
02:49 actually what we're going to do
02:53 is we're going to run out of our nude packages, now, this is a bit of annoying,
02:59 so we want to go to our project here, this is our web client test,
03:04 and we need to go into our Node modules
03:06 and we need to go into the hidden bin folder,
03:10 how do I do this here in Mac OS.
03:13 So let's go over here real quick, and we can get to it this way
03:18 I'm sure this is easier on Windows, but we want to just go to our .bin
03:23 and here we have Electron, so once we open this
03:26 now we can get to this, it is unfortunately a little annoying,
03:30 drag this over here and now we're inside our hidden folder and we can select that.
03:36 So, it's not the super easiest thing to do, but we can pick that right there.
03:40 And then, we want to set the working directory
03:45 to be the directory down inside the course there
03:49 so right here, all right,
03:52 and then finally, we need to set the file that is going to be main.js in this example
03:59 maybe you've named yours something else.
04:01 Alright, so not the easiest thing in the world,
04:04 but we've got our Electron selected, we've got the right working directory,
04:08 now, what happens if I run this, wait for it,
04:12 bam, there it is, let's just make some changes
04:14 to see that this is actually doing a thing.
04:18 Electron is fun, we could do something like this,
04:28 all right, so we made this little proclamation that hey Electron is fun
04:33 let's run it again, notice that right there, how cool is this?
04:38 So we are doing full on Electron JS inside of PyCharm,
04:42 so just leveraging the fact that really this is WebStorm plus PyCharm, it's a super set.
04:50 So, super cool, I definitely think playing with Electron JS is fun,
04:53 but like I said, I do wish there was a Python equivalent
04:56 that really was as polished as Electron JS.
