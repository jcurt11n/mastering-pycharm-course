00:01 When you're working with large Python files,
00:03 sometimes it's nice to peek ahead and see what's out there,
00:06 what's at a certain level, maybe there's little error
00:09 and you are like, wow what is down there
00:11 what is that little squiggly in the scroll bar giving you a warning about.
00:14 So PyCharm has this thing called lens mode
00:17 and if you put the cursor right there, just near the scroll bar there
00:24 and you go up and down slowly,
00:26 it'll actually pop up this little lens further down in the file
00:30 so notice, look at the line numbers, it goes 3, 4, 5, up to 24,
00:33 and then straight to 70,
00:36 and that's because that lens mode also has the line numbers in it
00:39 and that's looking like a couple of screens down
00:43 like pretty much if you scrolled the scroll bar to where the yellow arrow is.
00:48 So be sure to make use of that if you're trying to like survey a large file
00:52 and you are like what is this stuff down here
00:54 and you don't want to lose your place,
00:56 you just kind of want to peek around— lens mode.
