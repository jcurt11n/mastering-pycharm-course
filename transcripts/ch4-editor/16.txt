00:01 You've seen what the editor can do.
00:03 Now, it's your turn to play with the editor
00:05 and try some of the more advanced features that we covered.
00:09 This is not going to cover everything,
00:11 but it's going to give you a few examples
00:13 of what I think are some of the major and most important
00:15 and most helpful features in the PyCharm editor.
00:19 So let's jump over to github and have a look.
00:22 So here in your turn 2 the editor,
00:25 we have some steps that you can follow along
00:27 and I encourage you to play with other aspects of the editor
00:31 as well open projects that you might have worked on
00:34 with other editors and so on.
00:36 But, if you follow these steps you will see some of the cool features in action.
00:39 Now, notice over here we have a project folder called bad wizard,
00:43 so you're going to start working with this bad wizard code right away
00:46 and first step is to go and open this up
00:48 so you've got to make sure you clone this repository so you have it,
00:52 and then, we're going to play with autocomplete a little bit,
00:55 so over here you have this hero, you can say hero.
00:57 I'll show you a bunch of options,
00:59 one of the things it doesn't have is a wake up method
01:01 so you're going to use the code intentions
01:03 and automatic code generation tooling
01:06 to generate this wake up method here.
01:08 We're also going to clean up the code according to pep 8,
01:11 remove some of the unused imports and document some of our functions.
01:15 So follow along here and you'll have a good understanding
01:19 of some of the cooler features
01:21 especially the code intentions and code formatting.
