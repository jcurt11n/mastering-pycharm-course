00:01 One of the really nice features is
00:03 you can use PyCharm no matter what operating system you use.
00:06 If you use Windows, if you use Mac, if you use Ubuntu or some form of Linux,
00:10 you can use PyCharm and it behaves more or less exactly the same way,
00:15 the key bindings might be slightly different,
00:17 command on Mac versus control on Windows or Linux, something like that,
00:21 but generally, they're exactly the same.
00:24 If you're working on teams, where different people have different platforms,
00:28 or you just want to use it on both the platforms,
00:32 it's cross-platform so you don't have to worry,
00:35 you don't have to say, "Well, Visual Studio might be cool,
00:39 but it only runs on Windows, so we're all getting Windows,"
00:42 you don't have to do that kind of thing with PyCharm,
00:44 which is very much in the Python ethos of running everywhere.
