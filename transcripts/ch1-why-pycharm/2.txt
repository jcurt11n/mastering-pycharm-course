00:01 If this is the first course you've taken from me,
00:03 you might be wondering who is this disembodied voice
00:05 speaking to you through this microphone, through the screen here.
00:08 Well, there I am, hi, my name is Michael, nice to meet you.
00:11 You can find me on Twitter at @mkennedy
00:13 and I'm super excited to be writing this course for you.
00:17 I'm really excited about PyCharm, I've been using it for many years
00:20 and I just think it's a great editor and I want to highlight all the ways
00:25 in which it can make your life better as you write software.
00:28 Some other things I've been up to,
00:31 you might know about the Talk Python To Me podcast,
00:33 this is the most popular Python podcast out there
00:36 and I've been hosting this for a couple of years,
00:38 talking to many of the experts including a couple of folks on the team
00:40 that built PyCharm itself, so there is some interesting looks inside PyCharm
00:45 and I'll try to share that information with you as well.
00:47 And of course, I founded Talk Python Training
00:50 which is probably where you're taking this course.
00:52 So, nice to meet you, and I'm looking forward to sharing
00:54 this whole course and PyCharm experience with you.
