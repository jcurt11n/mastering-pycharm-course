00:01 If you're new to Python, you might not realize
00:03 there's actually many different versions and flavors of Python.
00:06 So if you just say Python, you mean something called C Python
00:11 and that's what you get if you go to Python.org and you download it
00:15 or you just go to Linux and type Python, that's C Python.
00:19 But there's actually a bunch of different runtimes
00:21 and sometimes these are called interpreters
00:23 but I don't like the term interpreters, because not all of them are interpreters
00:26 some of them are JIT compilers.
00:28 So runtimes is what I am going to say.
00:30 We have the two sort of direct Python ones I would say,
00:35 on the right here this snake is PyPy,
00:38 and this is a JIT version of the Python runtime,
00:43 implemented in Python, it's very meta
00:45 hence the circle is eating itself, that sort of thing.
00:48 In some circumstances, this can be much faster
00:51 but it doesn't have as much coverage
00:55 of all of the languages, all of the libraries and stuff that you might use
00:58 especially some of the C based extensions and things like that,
01:01 so you don't always want to just use PyPy
01:03 but if you want to, you'll see that it is supported in PyCharm, which is cool.
01:07 Same thing for Cython, we saw that on the feature page just a little bit ago
01:10 and Cython is a way to take Python code and compile it down the machine instructions
01:16 not even JIT compiled, just straight up like C compiled
01:19 but it uses a kind of a flavor of Python
01:22 and that is supported with Intellisense
01:24 and language understanding and everything in PyCharm.
01:26 Then we have the two plugin ones, Jython and IronPython
01:31 and this is plugging into Java and .Net respectively, those are also supported.
01:35 So regardless of how you want to run your Python code
01:38 any of these are supported with language validation and things like that
01:44 in PyCharm, which is pretty awesome.
