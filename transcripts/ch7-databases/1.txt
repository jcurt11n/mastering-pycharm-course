00:01 We've come to our database section
00:03 and almost all major applications use databases and they generate tons of data
00:07 and working with it is really, really important.
00:11 It can be the difference between that
00:13 super slow laggy type of experience or super fast and crisp,
00:17 so we're going to see what PyCharm has to offer in the realm of databases.
00:21 It's quite a bit.
00:23 First let's ask the question— why is working with relational data hard?
00:27 Well, there's a couple of reasons,
00:29 but one of the primary reasons is actually broken or suboptimal tools.
00:34 We don't often have great, especially visual tools
00:38 to help us explore and interact and modify even the schema of our databases,
00:46 so yes, sometimes there are tools for this,
00:49 but typically it's some specialized database tool if it even exists
00:54 that we need to use, it's not built right into our editor
00:58 and you'll see some really amazing stuff that can happen
01:00 because the data tools are integrated with our editing tools.
01:05 Well, I'd say it's also hard because migrations
01:08 you know, changing the schema after you put data in the database in production,
01:12 yeah that's hard,
01:15 and object/relational mismatches,
01:16 so yeah, working with relational data can be harder than maybe it should be
01:21 but those last two, those are just the nature of relational databases
01:24 so we're going to focus on the tools that PyCharm has
01:28 that can really level up your experience of working with data.
01:32 Remember this Pyramid here,
01:34 we've got IntelliJ, WebStorm, DataGrip and PyCharm
01:36 and PyCharm is sort of the Python tools plus all these other things.
01:41 In this chapter what we're going to focus on really lives right here,
01:45 everything is going to come from DataGrip
01:48 except for the final little feature that we're going to talk about,
01:52 which is pretty awesome, it has to do with Python plus DataGrip
01:55 but pretty much everything else is kind of a DataGrip type feature.
