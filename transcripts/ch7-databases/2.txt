00:01 Now, in order to make working with the database tools interesting
00:04 and have real data, I created this simple little application that we can play with,
00:09 some of which I copied from a previous class, some of which I wrote from scratch.
00:13 So, if you look here, we've got our main method
00:18 it sort of sets up some data access stuff and then it calls list_albums,
00:22 and notice, this may look familiar to you, this is a SQLAlchemy statement
00:27 so we're creating a database session
00:30 and we're creating a query based on the album class
00:34 which is a model mapped into the database,
00:38 and we're getting everything, we'll just order
00:40 by the name descending, reverse alphabetical
00:43 and then we're just looping over them
00:45 and we're actually traversing a foreign key relationship over to a track table here,
00:50 we're not actually pulling back the tracks, but we are doing a length on them.
00:54 So first, let's run this, you can see, nothing super exciting,
00:57 there are two albums in our database,
00:59 the Year of The Snake, which has five tracks
01:02 and Digital Age Boys and Girls, six tracks.
01:04 Okay, so this actually comes from my Python for Entrepreneurs class,
01:08 The Blue Yellow Rockets app is a thing we built,
01:11 so let's just look super quick, we're using SQLALchemy,
01:14 there is nothing in the tooling that really matters around SQLAlchemy
01:17 we're just happy to be playing with it through there.
01:20 So over here we have an album class
01:23 which derives from SQLAlchemy base, it's mapped to the table album
01:25 and it has a bunch columns, and interestingly,
01:28 we've got indexes and uniqueness constraints
01:32 and things like that, like the name is indexed and it has to be unique.
01:36 Similarly over here, we've got our albums
01:40 and there's a foreign key relationship from the album id back to the album's id.
01:45 Alright, so that generated this database over here
01:49 you can see we're basically connecting to SQLite
01:54 and we could connect to lots of different databases as we'll see,
01:58 but connecting to SQLight means there's really no server for you to set up
02:01 so it's as easy as it can be to play this demo.
02:04 With that in place, what we're going to do really is
02:07 explore the data that was created by this application in this little database
02:12 and we'll do that in the next couple of sections.
