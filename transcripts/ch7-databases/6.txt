00:01 The final operation we want to work with here
00:03 is to possibly change the schema,
00:05 what if we need to add a column, or add an index or something like that,
00:08 we can go over here and right click and say modify column for existing ones
00:13 here we could change stuff about it like it could become unique
00:16 or autoincrementing, or something like that
00:20 we could also go to the keys, go to the indexes
00:24 and say we want to add an index on whatever, right
00:29 go in here and add those things.
00:32 So we can edit it on the column by column
00:37 or probably it makes more sense to modify the table like so,
00:40 so we come over here and basically it was
00:43 as if we had double clicked one of these things
00:45 it doesn't really matter that much
00:47 but we could add say a column here
00:49 and this will be rating, and this is going to be an int,
00:53 and the default will be two,
00:56 and yeah, it's fine, we'll just go with that.
01:00 We can either execute this in the database,
01:02 and notice this, this is really sweet, alter table,
01:05 this is the stuff I always forget when I'm working with relational databases,
01:08 oh yeah, what's the DDL to change the type of a column
01:12 but it has data in it, so you have to like transform, like— what do I do.
01:16 This is the kind of stuff you do right here, so here's the script
01:19 and I could hit just boom, execute it and it will modify the database
01:23 or I could say just open this here in this editor
01:27 and I could make these changes and when I'm ready,
01:29 I push this button and run it, and then I make the changes,
01:32 let's go over here comment that out and run this,
01:35 alter table, one row is affected that sounds like something happened
01:41 and let's go resync, oh there is a rating, that's an integer,
01:44 I don't like it anymore, we'll go over here and we can just remove it.
01:48
01:53 Alright, so we're going to begin a transaction
01:55 drop a bunch of stuff, recreate it, that's pretty intense
01:57 but if we do that now our rating is gone again,
02:00 so this modifying data— not the simplest thing to do in relational databases,
02:05 like I said at the start, I think this is one of the harder parts
02:08 to evolve your database especially once it has data in it,
02:11 but, not too bad with the tools we have at hand here.
